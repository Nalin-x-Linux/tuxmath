About The Images and Sounds Used In This Game
---------------------------------------------

All Tux4Kids programs are intended to be fully compliant with the Debian Free
Software Guidelines.  To the best of my knowledge, the programs are currently
in compliance.  Any deviation from these guidelines is unintentional, and
should be brought to the attention of the Tux4Kids developers.

The graphics and sounds used in tuxmath are all either licensed under terms
that allow free redistribution, or are in the public domain, as summarized
below to the best of my (David Bruce's) knowledge. Licenses are GPL except as
otherwise noted.

During 2009 and 2010, nearly all of the png images in TuxMath were converted to
SVG equivalents by members of the Tux4Kids project using free software tools.
The derived images are licensed under the same terms as the originals.
