"Tux, of Math Command" is an educational math tutorial game starring Tux,
the Linux Penguin in which you play the part of Commander Tux, as he
defends his friends from an attack of math equations. Comets are
crashing towards the friendly penguins in their igloos, and you must
destroy the comets by solving their equations.

As of version 1.7.0, TuxMath also includes a completely new game
activity, "Factoroids", which gives practice in factoring numbers and
simplifying fractions, as well as zapping rocks floating through
space.
