04 May 2011 - for Tux Math 2.0.3

All of the source code in Tux Math is now uniformly licensed under the GNU
General Public License, version 3 (or later).  This includes the "GPL2 or
later" code retained from earlier releases, as well as all of the changes since
our last public release.  

Prior to this date, Tux Math was understood to be a "GPL2 or later" project,
although many of the source code files had missing or incomplete copyright and
license notices.  Some of the files, however, were labeled as "GPL3 or later".

If you wish to use Tux Math's previous source code in a GPL2 project, feel free
to download our last public release prior to the license change
(tuxmath_w_fonts-1.8.0.tar.gz) at http://tux4kids.alioth.debian.org. Unless a
file in that archive says "GPL3 or later", I believe that the code can be
freely re-used in GPL2 projects.  If code labeled "GPL3 or later" was written
within the Tux4Kids project, please contact us as we very likely would agree to
re-license it for a GPLv2 project.

Note to Tuxmath developers: It should be very easy to keep the code in
compliance with license documentation requirements.  Basically, if you edit a
file, just add your name to the list of authors at the top of the file, and add
the current year to the list of copyright years.  If you create a new file,
copy the notice from one of the existing files and adapt it as appropriate.
